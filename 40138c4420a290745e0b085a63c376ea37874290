please use async instead of non-blocking in all places. I think async is a term used more frequently in this case. 

A nonblocking call returns immediately with whatever data are available: the full number of bytes requested, fewer, or none at all.

An asynchronous call requests a transfer that will be performed in its whole(entirety) but will complete at some future time.

lets simply use method overload, giving this the same name Check(...

and comment this as synchronous call instead of blocking call, since async is more accurate than non-blocking

note many classic methods just use a single method to cover both async and sync. In google, stubby is an example of that. Basically, on_check_done=nullptr means synchronous call. But I am fine if you want to have two methods. Just use the same name then. SyncCheck(), AsyncCheck() also works.

Add a todo that we will revisit if we want to expose FlushAll() when we open source this client library.
rule of thumb for a good api: only expose what needs to be exposed.
