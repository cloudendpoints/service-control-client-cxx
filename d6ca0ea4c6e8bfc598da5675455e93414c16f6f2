per our discussion, could you add a boolean field is_flushing_ to indicate if we have duplicate flushing requests for the same cache entry in the same time. You can just do a log(warning) to check if this happens for now. If this really causes some problem, we have some insight into that. But in general, I think we should be fine giving 1 second flush interval.
